## [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)

To install all of our protobuf, rust, and go toolchains install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html), then run:
```
mise trust
mise install
```

**Recommended**: Add [mise shell integration](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise) so that the mise environment will automatically activate when you are this repo, giving you access to all executables and environment variables. Otherwise you will need will need to either manually `mise activate [SHELL]` or run all commands with the `mise exec` prefix.

## Generate proto files

After modifying the proto files, you can generate the Go files with the following command:

```
make
```

## Bitcoind

Our SO implementation uses ZMQ to listen for block updates from bitcoind. Install it with:

```
brew install zeromq
```

Note: whatever bitcoind you are running will also need to have been compiled with ZMQ.
The default installation via brew has ZMQ, but binaries downloaded from the bitcoin core
website do not.

```
brew install bitcoin
```

## DB Migrations

We use atlas to manage our database migrations. Install via `mise install`.

To make a migration, follow these steps:

- Make your change to the schema, run `make ent`
- Generate migration files by running `./scripts/gen-migration.sh <name>`:
- When running in minikube or `run-everything.sh`, the migration will be automatically
  applied to each operator's database. But if you want to apply a migration manually, you can run (e.g. DB name is `sparkoperator_0`):

```
atlas migrate apply --dir "file://so/ent/migrate/migrations" --url "postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/sparkoperator_0?sslmode=disable"
```

- Commit the migration files, and submit a PR.

If you are adding atlas migrations for the first time to an existing DB, you will need to run the migration command with the `--baseline` flag.

```
atlas migrate apply --dir "file://so/ent/migrate/migrations" --url "postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/sparkoperator_0?sslmode=disable" --baseline 20250228224813
```

## VSCode

If spark_frost.udl file has issue with VSCode, you can add the following to your settings.json file:

```
"files.associations": {
    "spark_frost.udl": "plaintext"
}
```

## Linting

Golang linting uses `golang-ci`, installed with `mise install`.


To run the linters, use either of
```
mise lint

golangci-lint run
```

## Run tests

### Unit tests

```
mise test-go # works from any directory
mise test # works from the spark folder
```
or

In spark folder, run:

```
go test $(go list ./... | grep -v -E "so/grpc_test|so/tree")
```

## E2E tests

The E2E test environment can be run locally in minikube via `./scripts/local-test.sh` for hermetic testing (recommended) or run locally via `./run-everything.sh`.

#### Local Setup (`./run-everything.sh`)
```
brew install tmux
brew install sqlx-cli # required for LRC20 Node
brew install cargo # required for LRC20 Node
```

##### bitcoind

See bitcoin section above.

##### postgres

You also need to enable TCP/IP connections to the database.
You might need to edit the following files found in your `postgres` data directory. If you installed `postgres` via homebrew, it is probably in `/usr/local/var/postgres`. If you can connect to the database via `psql`, you can find the data directory by running `psql -U postgres -c "SHOW data_directory;"`.

A sample `postgresql.conf`:

```
hba_file = './pg_hba.conf'
ident_file = './pg_ident.conf'
listen_addresses = '*'
log_destination = 'stderr'
log_line_prefix = '[%p] '
port = 5432
```

A sample `pg_hba.conf`:

```
#type  database  user  address       method
local   all       all                trust
host    all       all   127.0.0.1/32 trust
host    all       all   ::1/128      trust
```

#### Hermetic/Minikube Setup (`./scripts/local-test.sh`)

##### minikube

See: [spark/minikube/README.md](https://github.com/lightsparkdev/spark/blob/main/minikube/README.md)

Please run: `spark/minikube/setup.sh`, then `./scripts/local-test.sh`. If want to make local code changes visible in minikube, you'll need to

```
# 1. Build the image
./scripts/build-to-minikube.sh
# OR
mise build-so-dev-image

# 2. Run minikube with the local image
./scripts/local-test.sh --dev-spark
```

### Running tests

Golang integration tests are in the spark/so/grpc_test folder.
JS SDK integration tests are across the different JS packages, but can be run together in the js/sdks directory, or in each package's own directory, via `yarn test:integration`.

In the root folder, run:

```
# Local environment
./run-everything.sh
```

OR

```
# Hermetic/Minikube environment
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/local-test.sh [--dev-spark] [--keep-data]
#
# Options:
#   --dev-spark         - Sets USE_DEV_SPARK=true to use the locally built dev spark image
#   --dev-lrc20         - Sets USE_DEV_LRC20=true to use the locally built dev lrc20 image
#   --keep-data         - Sets RESET_DBS=false to preserve existing test data (databases and blockchain)
#
# Environment Variables:
#   RESET_DBS           - Whether to reset operator databases and bitcoin blockchain (default: true)
#   USE_DEV_SPARK       - Whether to use the dev spark image built into minikube (default: false)
#   USE_DEV_LRC20       - Whether to use the dev lrc20 image built into minikube (default: false)
#   SPARK_TAG           - Image tag to use for both Spark operator and signer (default: latest)
#   LRC20_TAG           - Image tag to use for LRC20 (default: latest)
#   USE_LIGHTSPARK_HELM_REPO - Whether to fetch helm charts from remote repo (default: false)
#   OPS_DIR             - Path to the Lightspark ops repository which contains helm charts (auto-detected if not set)
#   LRC20_REPLICAS      - The number of LRC20 replicas to deploy (default: 3)

./scripts/local-test.sh

# CTR-C when done to remove shut down port forwarding
```

then run your tests

```
mise test-grpc  # from anywhere in the repo

# OR

go test -failfast=false -p=2 ./so/grpc_test/...  # in the spark folder

# OR

gotestsum --format testname --rerun-fails ./so/grpc_test/...  # if you want prettier results and retries
```

In the sdks/js folder, you can run:
```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test:integration
```

#### Troubleshooting

1. For local testing, operator (go) and signer (rust) logs are found in `_data/run_X/logs`. For minikube, logs are found via kubernetes. [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a great tool to investigate your minikube k8 cluster.
2. If you don't want to deal with `tmux` commands yourself, you can easily interact with tmux using the `iterm2` GUI and tmux control mode.
From within `iterm2`, you can run:

```tmux -CC attach -t operator```

3. The first time you run `run-everything.sh` it will take a while to start up. You might actually need to run it a couple of times for everything to work properly. Attach to the `operator` session and check out the logs.

4. Having trouble with mise? You can always run `mise implode` and it will remove mise entirely so you can start over.
